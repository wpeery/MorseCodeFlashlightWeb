This app is intended to be used for two people to communicate with Morse code. One person can transmit a message with their flashlight and the other person can use their camera to  decode the message. However, it is possible to test the app with a single device. Point the device at a wall or reflective surface and transmit a message. Then quickly switch to the camera view and start recording while the flashlight is still transmitting the message. The app should be able to decode most of the message except for the first word which may not get fully captured.
